		<div class="naujiena" > The Federal Government has been urged to remain focused at stimulating private sector-driven aviation sector in 2019.
It was also charged to ensure that the airport concessioning project came to fruition, as the project appears to be in statement only in the last four years.
President, Aviation Round Table (ART), Gabriel Olowo, told New Telegraph at the weekend that although efforts of government to grow the sector in the past years were remarkable, they were, however, not enough, apart from the Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB), which achieved maximum results with the early and consistent release of accident and incident reports.
Olowo observed that government could not bring in the expected growth in the system alone without the collaboration with private investors, who would accelerate development in the system, stressing that planned airport concession by the government had remained only verbal statement in the last four years without action to implement the policy.
He further stated that the Murtala Muhammed Airport (MMA), Lagos, deserves more attention from the government in terms of growth strategy, intermodal connectivity and top of the rank security and technology apparatus, stressing that Lagos comes as a natural West African hub and currently generates 60 to 65 per cent revenue, which sustains unviable airports in the country.
The year 2018, he reiterated, witnessed modest effort by government, its agencies and practising stakeholders, stressing that while airports, airlines and airspace experienced some growth with AIB delivering maximally.
These efforts, he said, should translate more into good results during 2019 in spite of being the election year faced with strong apprehension.
His words: “Since 2014, aviation business outcome in Nigeria has been on the decline year-on-year basically due to economic recession and yet to improve difficult environment of doing business despite effort of government to ease the process, no thanks to the bureaucrats and their different agenda especially hinged on security. Nevertheless, Nigeria aviation market remains strong and good for Investment.
“Government at the centre should remain focused at stimulating private sector driven aviation sector during 2019. Airport concessioning remains only in statement over four years, action is required against existing airport government monopoly.”
Besides, Olowo enjoined government to consistently carry out scheduled maintenance on airports especially the Port Harcourt and Abuja airports, which were commissioned in October and December, respectively.     </div>
